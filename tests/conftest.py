"""Fleet-wide test-harness self-healing: `.uv-workspace-siblings/agent-utilities`.

`pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.uv.sources]` resolves the `agent-utilities`
dependency through the gitignored `.uv-workspace-siblings/agent-utilities`
symlink (it must be gitignored — it's a machine-local absolute path). Only
the canonical checkout has it hand-created; a freshly created `git worktree`
never gets one, so the FIRST `uv sync` in a new worktree fails outright:

    error: Distribution not found at:
    file://.../.uv-workspace-siblings/agent-utilities

Three lanes hit this independently on 2026-08-27/28 and each fixed it by
hand. This mirrors the self-healing pattern agent-webui's `pnpm-build`
pre-commit hook already uses for its own missing `node_modules`
(`test -d node_modules || pnpm install`): provision the missing, gitignored,
worktree-local artifact idempotently instead of requiring every lane to
remember to hand-create it.

LIMITATION: this only self-heals a venv that has ALREADY been synced at
least once (e.g. the symlink was later deleted by `git clean`) — once
synced, uv's editable-install finder points at the resolved absolute path,
not the symlink, so pytest runs fine without it from then on. It CANNOT fix
the very first `uv sync` in a brand-new worktree, because pytest itself is
not installed until that sync succeeds. For that case, run this file
directly, once, before your first sync:

    python tests/conftest.py && uv sync --extra test --extra mcp

    """Fleet-wide test-harness defect: reset sys.argv to a single clean
    element before every test.

    Several tests in this suite exercise this package's own argparse-based
    CLI entrypoint — directly via `get_mcp_instance()`/`agent_server()`, or
    indirectly via `runpy.run_module(..., run_name="__main__")` — and that
    argparse call reads the LIVE `sys.argv`. Left alone, pytest's own
    invocation flags (`-p no:randomly`, `-n auto`, `--randomly-seed=...`, ...)
    end up in that argv and are rejected by the module's CLI parser:

        error: argument -p/--port: invalid int value: 'no:randomly'

    which makes `pytest tests/ -q -p no:randomly` disagree with a plain
    `pytest tests/ -q` run -- not a real regression, just this trap. A
    handful of call sites already pin their own argv locally (e.g. via
    `patch("sys.argv", [...])` around a `runpy.run_module` call); those
    still work unchanged, since that local patch simply overrides this
    fixture's baseline for the duration of its own `with` block, and
    monkeypatch restores this baseline afterward. This fixture is the
    fleet-wide backstop for every OTHER call site (most of them direct
    `get_mcp_instance()` calls with no local patch at all) that the
    per-call-site fix in WD4-FIX-01 could not enumerate exhaustively. See
    plans/complex/waves/wD4/WD4-FIX-01.md defect (a).
